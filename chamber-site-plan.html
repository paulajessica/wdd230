Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      The Chamberâ€™s early years could be characterized as an organization of businessmen
      who knew each other through their common activities in Brazil. It was a small community:
      news was scarce and communications difficult, so the Chamber became a convenient place to
      meet and exchange information..
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      It has continually updated its programs to respond to strengthen and widen its contacts
      with the public and private sectors, and to develop a professional staff to manage activities.
    </p>
